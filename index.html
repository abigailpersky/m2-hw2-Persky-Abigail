<h1> ALl About Abigail </h1>
<p> My name is Abigail Persky. The first question people usually ask me is if I prefer the name Abigail or Abby. I prefer my full name, but I won't be mad at you if you call me Abby. I am a Florida native, so it's safe to say I love the warmth, but I can rock winter wear when I need to. If I had to list some of my favorite shows on TV right now they would be: </p>
 <ul>
      <li> Impeachment</li>
        <li> Marvelous Mrs. Maisel </li>
        <li> Barry</li>
        <li> New Girl</li>
        <li> The Mandalorian</li>
    </ul>

 <h3> My Hobbies </h3>  
 <p> When I am not working or completing work towrads my Masters program, you can find me training for my next half marathon, watching movies, cheering on my favorite sports teams, or traveling. I know streaming services are convenient and comfortable but I don't think there is any thing like seeing a movie in a theater, so I am very excited to be watching the latest box office hits (and mmisses) in a movie theater post COVID-19. I am devoted sports fan for my teams: </p> 
<ol> 
    <li> Cleveland Browns</li>
    <li> Tampa Bay Lightning</li>
    <li> Southern Methodist University Mustangs</li>
    <li> South Carolina Gamecocks</li>
</ol>
<p> I know I am a student at University of Florida, but I cannot bring myself to root for them. However, I am a devoted Browns fan, my 18 days of my year are dedicated to holding my breath and hoping they don't embarass me. Unfortunately they do. </p>

<h4> My Career Goals</h4>
<p> Currently I am in account services for TBWA/WorldHealth. I am learning so much and love my job. I am excited to be earning my masters in digital strategy at such a ripe point in my career. As an account executive I get to partner with my agency's startegy team in their development of tactics for our clients and their work. I'd love within the next two years following my graduation with my masters use what I am learning to transition from account services to strategy. I love working with client and I feel that strategy is an intersection where I can be client facing while also developing and challenging their brands or products to best reach and serve their audiences.
